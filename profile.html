      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am someone with a strong interest in technology and digital
        development. I enjoy the process of learning, experimenting, and turning
        ideas into real, usable digital solutions. For me, technology is not
        just about writing code, but about creating solutions that make things
        easier, more efficient, and more enjoyable for users.
      </p>
      <p>
        In every project I work on, I aim to combine functionality, aesthetics,
        and efficiency so the final result not only works well but also delivers
        a great user experience. I am always open to new challenges, enjoy
        collaborating with others, and continuously strive to improve my skills
        to keep up with the ever-evolving world of technology.
